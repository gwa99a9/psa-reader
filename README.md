## API Endpoint

The project includes an API endpoint that allows you to search for torrents. The endpoint is accessible at:

```
http://localhost:8000/search=<search_query>
```

### Endpoint URL Parameters

The API endpoint accepts the following URL parameter:

- `search_query` (required): The search query to look for in the torrents database. Use this parameter to specify the name or keywords related to the torrents you want to search.

### Example API Request

To search for torrents using the API endpoint, send a GET request to the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8000/search=<search_query>
```

Replace `<search_query>` with the desired search query.

### Example API Response

The API response will be in JSON format and will contain an array of objects representing the search results. Each object will contain the following information:

- `ID`: The unique identifier of the torrent.
- `Name`: The name of the torrent.
- `URL`: The URL of the torrent.
- `Size`: The size of the torrent.
- `Date`: The date of the torrent.

Here's an example of a JSON response:

```json
[
  {
    "ID": 1,
    "Name": "Torrent 1",
    "URL": "https://example.com/torrent1",
    "Size": "1 GB",
    "Date": "2023-06-08"
  },
  {
    "ID": 2,
    "Name": "Torrent 2",
    "URL": "https://example.com/torrent2",
    "Size": "500 MB",
    "Date": "2023-06-07"
  }
]
```

Please note that you need to have the project running and the server active in order to use the API endpoint.

Feel free to experiment with different search queries and integrate the API endpoint into your own applications.
